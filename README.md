# AI Programming with Python and PyTorch Project

Project code for Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning with PyTorch Nanodegree program.

This project demonstrates how to build, train and validate a neural network using PyTorch for the purpose of image processing.

The project uses flower images from this location: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html

Additionally, the project contains 2 command line tools:
* train.py: a tool to train the image processing neural network
* predict.py: a tool that takes an image and a neural network definition file (generated by train.py) and tells you what flower the image is of.

# Dependencies:

The project was built and tested with:
* Python 3.9
* torch 1.7.1
* torchvision0.8.2
* torchaudio0.7.2
* CUDA 10.1
